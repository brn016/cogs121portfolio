                            Clarity of User Instructions</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">One of the most important things we wanted to focus on is the process of using our application. When writing user instructions, we need to make sure the instructions are clear and that the process makes sense. User flow is integral to this application because we seek to add some organization to team ideation. If the user flow is illogical, or if the steps are unclear, we have defeated the purpose of our own application</p>

                            Ease of Use</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As with any application, the application should be easy to use. But, as we are not creating high fidelity prototypes, there are some necessary steps to make our prototype work that would not be in a fully flushed out application. To the best of our ability, we wanted to make sure that the process of using multiple Google platforms was as easy as possible for users.</p>

                            Comprehension of Interface</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Although we were using several different platforms to simulate our social experience, the interfaces we are using should still be fairly straightforward and should not leave users constantly wondering which buttons to press in order to progress through the app. This criteria mainly focuses on how clear the UI is to use while reading the directions on what task they need to perform.</p>

                <blockquote><p><strong>The first prototype focused on two main areas: making sure the user flow was logical, and that the UI was not difficult to use. We conducted tests with our prototype in a small group of about 10-15 users. Their task was to pretend they are a group of friends deciding on how to celebrate their graduation.</strong></p><p><strong>The task was to first submit ideas through a form, then proceed to a sheet where they could comment/question the idea and then they could vote on the ideas they liked best. Between the commenting and voting was a verbal discussion about the various ideas.</strong></p><p><strong>Following the completion of the user task, users were asked to fill out an short evaluation form on the process and the UI. Most user feedback indicated that the flow of user tasks was very logical and straight forward. They also noted that they enjoyed the "small amount of organization" this platform brought to group brainstorming. In contrast, users noted that improvements needed to be made to the UI as the voting button and commenting area were difficult to use.</strong></p><p><strong>Other suggestions for additions/improvements to our application were to consider creating a better way to view comments/submitted media in addition to a way to visualize the results of voting.</strong></p><p><strong>Coming away from this, our group decided to stick to the user flow as we had it, and to focus on improvements to the UI to make it easier to use, especially in the area of commenting and voting. We also added goals to create better visualizations.</strong></p></blockquote>

                <blockquote><p><strong>After making improvements to the UI by added a new interface for commenting and voting, as well as implementing a visualzation where ideas that are more favored get a darker color background in their cells. During round two testing, the user task was modified to generating ideas for a hypothetical recreation of the current class, COGS 123 as a two part, series course.</strong></p><p><strong>The user task was very similar. Users first had to submit ideas, but instead of going to a sheet to comment on them, users could submit comments on another form, generated from the user ideas. After commenting, they could go to the sheet to view everyone's comments and have a verbal discussion. Afterwards, they would vote on the same sheet, and they would be able to see which ideas were the most popular as the more highly voted an idea, the background color for the cell of that idea would darken.</strong></p><p><strong>Upon completion of the user task, we asked users to fill out a feedback form for the prototype in addition to giving us verbal feedback. The feedback indicated that our change in the commenting process was very helpful. Giving users a form rather than a sheet made it a lot simplier for comments to be added. Additionally, users liked how there was an indicator for which ideas were most highly voted. We did however run into some technical issues that affected about half of our users which prevented them from voting.</strong></p><p><strong>Other feedback that we received is that, although the tool could be helpful, its not exactly a novel idea. There are other ways for team to collectively ideate already deployed. What we thought was a bit different for our users is that we leverage the fact that they are in the same space and use the comments and questions they have to lead a discussion while we are in the same room. Other applications may be better for teams that are not co-located, but we feel that, an in person exchange is always more beneficial to teams.</strong></p></blockquote>
